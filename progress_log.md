# Session Log: Vision and Motion Integration for the NAO Robot

## Session 1: Vision Integration

In this session, we successfully added and debugged the function to get images from the robot's camera.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Initial Interaction:** Successfully controlled the robot's arms using `set_arm_position`, making it wave.
2.  **Vision Implementation in the Controller:**
    *   Code was added to `controllers/my_controller_plus_mcp/my_controller_plus_mcp.py` to initialize the camera.
    *   Implemented handling of the new `get_camera_image` command, which saves a snapshot from the camera to `data/camera_image.jpg`.
    *   Added a `last_image_timestamp` to the `status.json` file.
3.  **Debugging:** Went through several debugging cycles to get the controller to process commands correctly (an issue with `timestamp`).
4.  **First Image:** We successfully received the first image from the robot's camera.
5.  **Philosophical Moment:** I recorded my first impressions of what I saw in the `data/my_first_view.md` file.
6.  **MCP Server Refinement:**
    *   A new `get_camera_image` tool was added to `webots_mcp_server.py`.
    *   This tool encapsulates the logic of sending the command, waiting for the update, and reading the image file.

## Session 2: Implementation of Arbitrary Motions

In this session, we implemented the ability to run arbitrary motion files (`.motion`).

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Controller Modification (`my_controller_plus_mcp.py`):**
    *   Added handling for the new `play_motion` command in the `process_commands` function.
    *   The controller can now load and play any `.motion` file from the `motions` folder.

2.  **MCP Server Update (`webots_mcp_server.py`):**
    *   Added a new `play_motion(motion_name: str)` tool.
    *   This tool sends a command to the controller to start the corresponding motion.

3.  **Position Debugging:**
    *   Fixed an issue with an incorrect "zero" position of the arms. The robot now correctly lowers its arms and resets to the correct pose.
    *   Updated the `test_mcp.py` test script to include a test for lowering the arms.

## Session 3: Motion Debugging and Stabilization

In this session, we encountered a problem with the incorrect execution of complex animations, which manifested as jerky arm movements. Through iterative debugging, we arrived at a final solution.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Smooth Transition:** Implemented logic for a smooth transition from the current pose to the initial pose of the animation. This improved the visual perception but did not solve the main problem.
2.  **Diagnosis via Logs:** The key moment was discovering a `too big requested position` warning for the `LElbowRoll` motor in the Webots logs.
3.  **Discovering the Root Problem:** Analysis of the log showed that the controller did not have full control over all arm motors. The initialization list was missing the elbow and wrist motors.
4.  **Final Fix:** We added all the missing motors (`LElbowYaw`, `RElbowYaw`, `LElbowRoll`, `RElbowRoll`, `LWristYaw`, `RWristYaw`) to the `motor_names` list and the `set_initial_pose()` and `update_status()` functions in the `my_controller_plus_mcp.py` controller.
5.  **Successful Test:** After the fix, I successfully performed the "Forwards" motion, which confirmed the correctness of the solution.
6.  **Documentation:** Recorded a detailed history of the debugging in the `motion_debugging_story.md` file.

## Session 4: Expanding MCP Server Functionality

In this session, we added a new feature to the MCP server to get a list of available motions.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Code Analysis:** I studied `webots_mcp_server.py` to understand how to add new tools.
2.  **Adding the `list_motions` tool:** A new `list_motions` function, decorated as `@mcp.tool()`, was added to `webots_mcp_server.py`.
3.  **Implementation:** The function scans the `motions/` directory and returns a list of names of all files with the `.motion` extension.
4.  **Documentation:** Logged this change.

## Session 5: Refactoring the Vision System

In this session, we abandoned the non-working scanning system in favor of a simpler and more reliable approach using direct image retrieval.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Removal of Scanning Code:** The code related to the `start_head_scan`, `stop_head_scan`, and `get_recognized_objects` functions was completely removed from `webots_mcp_server.py` and `controllers/my_controller_plus_mcp/my_controller_plus_mcp.py`.
2.  **Renaming and Clarification:** The `get_camera_image` tool was renamed to `get_visual_perception`. Its description was updated to clearly reflect its purpose — to get a single frame for analysis.
3.  **Simplification of Logic:** The corresponding state variables and command handlers were removed, which made the controller and server code cleaner and easier to understand.

## Session 6: Motion Demonstration

In this session, I demonstrated a series of movements for video recording.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Sequence Execution:** At the user's request, I performed a sequence of movements: `TurnLeft60`, `TurnRight60`, `TaiChi`, and `HandWave`.
2.  **Positive Evaluation:** The user highly praised the performance, noting its gracefulness.
3.  **Tool Correction:** During the dialogue, it was clarified that the `play_motion` tool should be called without the `.motion` extension in the file name. The tool's description was updated.

## Session 7: LED Control

In this session, we added the ability to control the robot's LEDs.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Controller Modification (`my_controller_plus_mcp.py`):**
    *   Added initialization of all the robot's LED devices.
    *   Implemented handling of the new `set_leds` command, which takes an integer color value and applies it to all LEDs.
2.  **MCP Server Update (`webots_mcp_server.py`):**
    *   Added a new `set_led_color(color: str, part: str = 'all')` tool.
    *   The tool allows setting the color by name ('red', 'green', 'blue', 'white', 'off') or in HEX format (e.g., '#FF0000').
    *   This provides a convenient way to control the robot's light indication.

## Session 8: Fixing Animation Duration Parsing

In this session, we fixed a critical bug that prevented the server from correctly determining the duration of animations from `.motion` files.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Problem Diagnosis:** It was discovered that the `play_motion` and `list_motions` functions in `webots_mcp_server.py` were returning a duration of `0.0` seconds. Analysis of the `Forwards.motion` file showed that the timestamps have the format `HH:MM:SS:ms` (e.g., `00:02:600`), which the code could not process.
2.  **Parser Fix:**
    *   I made changes to the `play_motion` and `list_motions` functions in the `webots_mcp_server.py` file.
    *   The new logic correctly parses the `HH:MM:SS:ms` time string, converts all components to milliseconds, sums them, and then converts them to seconds.
3.  **Preparation for Restart:** The changes are ready, and I am waiting for the server to be restarted for them to take effect.

## Session 9: Verification of Animation Duration Fix

In this session, we successfully tested and confirmed the fix for the animation duration parsing error after restarting the server.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Checking the Motion List:** I called the `list_motions` tool and made sure that it returns correct and non-zero duration values for all available animations.
2.  **Test Playback:** I executed the `play_motion` command for the "HandWave" motion. The command was successfully executed, and the server returned the correct duration of 5.0 seconds.
3.  **Confirmation of the Fix:** The testing confirmed that the changes made to `webots_mcp_server.py` for time parsing are working correctly.

## Session 10: Debugging and Creating a Universal Test Script

In this session, we encountered a fundamental incompatibility issue between the client and server parts of the `mcp` library, which made it impossible to call any tools. We solved this problem by abandoning `mcp` in favor of direct file exchange and created a reliable test script.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Problem Diagnosis:** After numerous failed attempts to call tools (`list_tools`, `get_robot_status`, and even a test `ping`), we finally determined that the `McpError: Invalid request parameters` error was caused by an incompatibility between the `mcp` and `FastMCP` libraries.
2.  **Change of Approach:** We decided to abandon the use of `mcp.client` for interacting with the server.
3.  **Implementation of File Exchange:** I completely rewrote the test script (`test_coordinates.py`), implementing in it the logic of direct exchange of commands and statuses through the `data/commands.json` and `data/status.json` files. This approach uses the already existing and reliable communication channel of the server with the controller.
4.  **Successful Testing:** The new script successfully passed tests for getting the status and controlling the robot's head, confirming the correctness of the chosen approach.
5.  **Creation of a Universal Runner:**
    *   We renamed the debugging script to `mcp_test_runner.py` to reflect its new role.
    *   Another test was added to the script — waving a hand (`play_motion` with `HandWave`), which made it more complete and universal.

## Session 11: Adding Coordinate Tracking

In this session, we successfully added the ability to track the robot's position in the world.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Controller Modification (`my_controller_plus_mcp.py`):**
    *   Added initialization of the robot's GPS sensor.
    *   The `update_status` function was expanded: it now reads data from the GPS (`gps.getValues()`) and adds a new `robot_position` key to `status.json` with the `x`, `y`, `z` coordinates.
2.  **Iterative Debugging:**
    *   The initial attempt to get the robot node via `robot.getSelf()` failed. The error was corrected to `robot.getFromDef("NAO")`.
    *   Subsequent analysis showed that `getFromDef` is also not the correct approach in this context. The final, correct solution is to use `gps.getValues()` directly without needing to get the robot node.
3.  **Test Script Update (`mcp_test_runner.py`):**
    *   A check for the presence and correctness of the `robot_position` field in the received status was added to the script.
4.  **Successful Verification:** The final run of `mcp_test_runner.py` confirmed that the controller correctly determines and transmits the coordinates, and the test script successfully receives and displays them.

## Current Status:

*   **System is fully functional:** All main tools (`get_visual_perception`, `play_motion`, `list_motions`, `set_led_color`, `get_robot_status` with coordinates) are working correctly.
*   **A reliable test script has been created:** `mcp_test_runner.py` allows testing the main functionality of the server, including getting coordinates.
*   I am ready to perform more complex tasks and command sequences.

## Next Steps:

*   Awaiting further instructions from the user.
